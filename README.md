# Osano's Google Tag Manager Template

Loads Osano's Consent Manager using Google Tag Manager. You will need to use a custom trigger `osano__cm--load-success` to load all non-essential tags so that they can be managed by Osano.

See [the documentation](https://docs.osano.com/osano-and-google-tag-manager) for details.
